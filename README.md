# Spark CN

A study group that aims at preparing for SDE Internship and discussing Leetcode problems. 

#### Leetcode Grinding Methodology

- How many?
  - **10 - 20** for each type of problems;
  - At least **200 - 300 for 3 rounds**.
- How to?
  - Same type of problems together to observe their connections;
  - First time: **5** **min** before checking answers;
  - Second time: Try implement with template;
  - Third time: Implement with template in **15 - 20** **min**.
- Don’t be ashamed for referring to other’s code:
  - Be sure to learn the best implementation from other’s code;
  - Learn new API / Data Structure / Template.
- Eventually you’ll gain:
  - Templates: Be able to choose the right template for the corresponding problem;
  - Calculate time and space complexity;
  - Coding style.
