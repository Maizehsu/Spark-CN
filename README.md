# Spark CN

A study group that aims at preparing for SDE Internship and discussing Leetcode problems. 

#### Leetcode Grinding Methodology

- How many?
  - **10 - 20** for each type of problems;
  - At least **200 - 300 for 3 rounds**.
- How to?
  - Same type of problems together to observe their connections; 
  - First time: **5** **min** before checking answers;
  - Second time: Try implement with template;
  - Third time: Implement with template in **15 - 20** **min**.
- Don’t be ashamed for referring to other’s code:
  - Be sure to learn the best implementation from other’s code;
  - Learn new API / Data Structure / Template.
- Eventually you’ll gain:
  - Templates: Be able to choose the right template for the corresponding problem;
  - Calculate time and space complexity;
  - Coding style.

#### How to commit

- Naming
  - *Code files* with `111.cpp`, `222.java`  or `333.py`;
  - *Notes* with `111_222_333.md` or `111_222_333.txt` in the corresponding folders;
  - *New folder* with the name of the topic or the template involved. 

- Feel free to 
  - Add *new problems* or your implementation of the existing problems;
  - Add *new folders* along with your *code and notes* to the corresponding topics;
  - Refine and alter the *existing notes / template*.
